### 🚀 Project Overview
This project transforms passive Aadhaar ecosystem logs into **Active Strategic Intelligence**. By analyzing aggregated Enrolment, Demographic Updates, and Biometric datasets, we decoded critical societal trends related to **Internal Migration**, **Child Saturation**, and **Compliance Behavior**.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Discoveries

### 1. Migration vs. Settlement Patterns
We distinguished between **"Labor Hubs"** and **"Family Hubs"** using a custom correlation index.
* **Surat (Gujarat):** Identified as a transient labor hub (High Adult Migration, Low Child Enrolment).
* **Murshidabad (West Bengal):** Identified as a family settlement hub (High Migration, High Child Enrolment).

### 2. The "Compliance Cycle"
Mandatory Biometric Updates (Age 5-17) are not voluntary but institutionally driven.
* **April & July:** Spikes correlated with School Admissions.
* **December:** Highest peak correlated with Board Exams & Scholarship KYCs.

### 3. Data Anomalies
* Detected a critical **Centralized Data Outage in August 2025**, leading to artificial cumulative spikes in September.
